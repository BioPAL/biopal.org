ESA’s forest mission, BIOMASS, uses a novel measuring technique to deliver new information on forest height and above-ground forest BIOMASS. BIOMASS is the first satellite to carry a P-band synthetic aperture radar. Thanks to the long wavelength of P-band, around 70 cm, the radar signal will slice through the whole forest layer. This will result in the signal being scattered back to the satellite according to individual elements of the forest. The scattered back signal will therefore carry information about the forest structure that can be used to infer parameters such as forest biomass and forest height. This means that the satellite has to carry an exceptional large antenna that measures 12 m across. Additionally, the mission will also have an experimental ‘tomographic’ phase to provide 3D views of forests.

Information from the Biomass mission will lead to a better understanding of the state of Earth’s forests, how they are changing over time, and advance our knowledge of the carbon cycle. Absorbing around two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year, forests play a crucial role in the carbon cycle and climate system. However, forest degradation and deforestation, particularly in tropical regions, are causing much of this otherwise stored carbon to be released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. Quantifying the global cycle is essential to understanding the rapid changes that forests are undergoing and the subsequent implications for our climate.

Measurements of forest biomass can be used as a proxy for stored carbon – but this is poorly quantified in most parts of the world. Data from the Biomass mission will reduce the major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes on land, including carbon fluxes associated with land-use change, forest degradation and forest regrowth. Observations from this new mission will also lead to better insight into rates of habitat loss and, hence, the impact this may be having on biodiversity in the forest environment. In addition, the Biomass mission will offer the opportunity to map subsurface geology in deserts and map the topography of forest floors.
