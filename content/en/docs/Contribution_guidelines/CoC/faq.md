  BioPAL Code of Conduct - Frequently Asked Questions
---

This FAQ attempts to address common questions and concerns around the BioPAL
community's Code of Conduct. If you still have questions after reading it,
please feel free to contact us at
[*biopal@esa.int*](mailto:biopal@esa.int).


## Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?

We think the BioPAL community is awesome. If you're familiar with the BioPAL
community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we
already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations
about behavior and making them explicit.

Maintaining a Code of Conduct forces us to consider and
articulate what kind of community we want to be, and serves as a constant
reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a
signpost to people looking to join our community that we feel these values are
important.

We know that the BioPAL community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to
make sure everyone else knows it too.

## What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?

For the most part, we do not think it means large changes. We think that the text
does a really good job describing the way the BioPAL community already conducts
itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave as they have
in the past.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the Code
of Conduct when in "official" BioPAL spaces. In practice, BioPAL spaces include mailing lists, various communication
channels, and events.

## What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

We are all stewards of our community, and are encouraged to participate in ways
that defend the values highlighted in this document and help others understand
when their actions go against these values (by engaging them and directing them
to this document if necessary). If that doesn't work, or if you need more help,
you can contact [*biopal@esa.int*](mailto:biopal@esa.int). For more details please see our [Reporting
Guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/coc/reporting/).
